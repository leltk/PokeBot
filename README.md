## Image generation 
The folder pokeTypes have the types and the background,
the images of the types I downloaded from this link http://www.rw-designer.com/icon-set/pokemon-types
credits to @Bobcat. The downloads are done with a webscrap script, the link has types of fake pokemons, so I deleted those types,
pokemons come from the poke api https://pokeapi.co
